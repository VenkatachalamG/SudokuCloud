# Sudoku Solver: Java App Deployed on AWS Lambda 

🚀This project is a Sudoku-solving Java application designed to solve partially filled Sudoku boards. The application takes a JSON input representing the Sudoku board and provides the fully solved board as output. It is deployed on AWS Lambda and can be invoked using the AWS CLI.


# Features
<ul>
<li>📌Solves partially completed Sudoku boards efficiently.</li>
<li>📌Accepts board input in JSON format.</li>
<li>📌Outputs the fully solved Sudoku board to an output file (output.json).</li>
</ul>

# Technologies Used
<ul>
  <li>🚀<b>Java</b>: The core programming language for the application.</li>
  <li>🚀<b>Maven</b>: Build automation tool for managing project dependencies</li>
  <li>🚀<b>AWS Lambda</b>: Serverless computing platform used to deploy and run the Sudoku solver.</li>
  <li>🚀<b>AWS CLI</b>: Command-line interface for invoking the Lambda function and managing AWS services.</li>
  <li>🚀<b>Jackson Library</b>: For JSON parsing and deserialization.</li>
</ul>

# Deployment

<ul>
  <li>🛠️The application is built as a <i>.jar</i> file using Maven.</li>
  <li>🛠️This <i>.jar</i> file is then uploaded and deployed on AWS Lambda for serverless execution.</li>
</ul>

# Getting Started

📝The project is structured as a Maven project, and the Sudoku solver logic is implemented in Java. To deploy and run the application, AWS Lambda is used, and the board input is managed via JSON requests.
